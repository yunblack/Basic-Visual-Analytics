# Basic Visual Analytics

I created a software program that shows a particular statistics requested by a user. The program is developed in Java language using Apache NetBeans 11.x as IDE. The data presented in this is taken from Huge Stock Market Dataset1 made available by Boris Marjanovic on Kaggle â€“ which is an online community of data scientists. This dataset contains CSV dataset folder ETFs presenting stock market data of an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). There are three types of stock


### charts:

1. High-Low Charts show the high and low price a stock attained for a particular period of time. The
chart displays a series of vertical lines where the top of the line shows the high price, the bottom
of the line the low price.

2. Open-High-Low-Close Charts show the high and low price a stock attained for a particular period
of time as well as the opening and closing prices of the stock for the same period. The chart shows
the same type of vertical lines displayed on a high-low chart. The opening and closing prices can
be shown in two ways: by markers on the line, or by open-close bars superimposed on the highlow lines.

3. Volume Charts show the volume of trading, and often appear as studies below the main chart.
Volume charts can be simple line charts, column charts, column charts in which the columns
appear as lines, or line charts showing drop lines.
